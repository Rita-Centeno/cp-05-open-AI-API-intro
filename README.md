# üßë‚Äçüç≥ Capstone Project - 05 - OpenAI API Introduction

In this repository, we're providing a beginner-friendly exploration of the OpenAI API and best practices for LLM prompting engineering.

## What's required

üß© <font color="#90EE90">OpenAI API Key.</font>
If you don't already have an OpenAI Key, it's essential to create one at <https://platform.openai.com/api-keys>. This key is crucial for accessing OpenAI's services.
<br>
> <font color="orange">Remember, it's vital to save this key securely and avoid sharing it because its use may incur costs.</font>

:warning: It's a best practice to store your API key in a file named `.env`. This file should not be tracked by Git (add `.env` to `.gitignore` file), ensuring it remains private and inaccessible to others. Only you, within your local repository, should have access to this sensitive information.

## Project setup

### Step 1: `.env` and `OpenAI API Key`

Create a file named .env within the root folder of this project. Inside this file, define a variable name and assign your OpenAI API Key to this variable, following this structure::
<br>

```text
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xiuFidWeFMx4NyxL6...

```

After this, you need to activate it and install the packages listed in requirements.txt. Here are the steps:

### Step 2: Create the Python environment by using this command

```bash
python -m venv env
```

> **Note**: `env` is the standard name for a Python environment.

### Step 3: Activate the Python environment

To activate the Python environment, the process differs between Windows and MacOS/Linux.

#### Environment activation in MacOS/Linux

For MacOS/Linux, use the following command to activate the environment:
<br>

```bash
source env/bin/activate
```

#### Environment activation in Windows

For Windows, the activation process differs. Could you provide the specific command or guidance for environment activation on a Windows system?
<br>

```bash
cd env\Scripts
activate

# or

env\Scripts\activate
```

In Windows, permission issues might arise when activating the Python environment. If you encounter this problem, in PowerShell or a VS Code terminal, you can resolve it by running the following command:
<br>

```bash
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```

---

> When the virtual environment is activated, you will see the environment name in the command prompt, indicating that you are now working within the virtual environment.

### Step 3: recreate the Python environment

<font color="red">‚ö†Ô∏è **Attention**: </font>before running the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`, ensure that you have activated your local Python environment (`env`).
<br>

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The requirements.txt file is essential within a Python environment. Running pip freeze captures a comprehensive list of installed packages and their respective versions. It's crucial to update the requirements.txt whenever you install a new package. You can do this by executing the following command:
<br>

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

This command ensures that the `requirements.txt` file remains up to date with the latest package installations and versions in your environment.
